# Comparing-ML-Models-for-Predicting-Song-Popularity
Assignments for Master of Data Science at University of Sydney
Originally submitted as the second assignment for COMP5310: Principles of Data Science at the University of Sydney. The goal of this assignment was to compare machine 
learning models studied in class on a dataset of choice. Models studied included both regressors and classifiers, which informed the models chosen for this study.
